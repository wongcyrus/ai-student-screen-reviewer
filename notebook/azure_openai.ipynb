    "  2. Students must **not communicate using messaging platforms** such as WhatsApp, Telegram, or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring and Reporting:**\n",
    "  - Actively observe and monitor students during the test for any potential rule violations.\n",
    "  - **Identify and document suspicious acts** (e.g., switching between unpermitted applications, unusual keyboard/mouse activity, or actions suggesting external communication).\n",
